# 🏆 In Memory of My First Project

This repository holds the memories of my first-ever project, a project so ambitious that it had the **potential to win a hackathon**... but instead, all that remains is this README. 😢

## 🚀 The Rise

Back in my **second year of college**, I participated in a **college hackathon** with a crazy idea:

### **An AI-powered Hostel Mess Management System**
A full-stack **MERN-based** system integrated with **Flask** for Machine Learning predictions.

✨ **Features I built from scratch (as a beginner!):**
- 📊 **Food prediction system** – Predicted the number of students eating each day using **KNN Machine Learning Model**.
- 🏷️ **Face recognition** – For daily attendance tracking and fake diet-off detection.
- 💳 **Payment gateway** – Integrated **Razorpay** for seamless transactions (testing mode).
- 🔑 **JWT-based authentication** – Separate login systems for **Admin** and **Students**.
- 💻 **Tech Stack:** React.js, Material-UI, MongoDB, Express.js, Python, Flask, Scikit-learn.

After **4 days of non-stop coding**, **no sleep**, and pushing through exhaustion, I finally completed the project **on the morning of the hackathon**. 🚀🔥

## 😭 The Fall

As the sun rose, I decided to **push my code to GitHub** for safekeeping.

But I was a beginner at Git back then... and **disaster struck**. 💀

1. I created a **new GitHub repo** and cloned it into an empty folder.
2. **Cut-pasted** my entire project into the folder. (Yeah, big mistake 😓)
3. Did `git add .`, `git commit -m "final commit"`, and `git push`.
4. Saw that **node_modules** was also being pushed. **PANIC MODE ACTIVATED.** 😱
5. Stopped the push and, in my sleep-deprived state, **clicked "Discard All Changes".**
6. Poof. **My entire project was deleted.** No backups. Nothing left. Just an **empty repo** and my broken soul. 💔

## 🌱 The Lesson

While this project never made it to the hackathon stage, it **taught me so much**:
- **Version control is important.** (Use Git properly, kids. 😅)
- **Never work for 4 days straight without sleep.** (Your brain stops functioning.)
- **Always have backups.** (External drives, cloud, ANYTHING.)

Today, all that remains of my first big project is **this README**... and a lesson I’ll never forget.

**If you've read this far, learn from my mistakes and always push your code properly!** 😆🙏
